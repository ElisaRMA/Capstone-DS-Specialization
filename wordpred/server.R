                             The goal of the project was to create a next-word prediction algorithm based on three text files provided by SwiftkeyÂ®. <br><br>
                             To create the app, the datasets were cleaned, transformed into corpus and tokenized. 
                             Next, a dataframe was created using the ngrams (2gram to 5gram) and their frequency. <br><br>
                             The dataframe contained 3 columns which were: <br>
                             1. ngrams - the last word, <br>
                             2. the last word of each ngram, <br>
                             3. the frequency of the respective ngram <br><br>
                             Following this step, the prediction function was created. The function used the backoff model, so it takes an input(phrase), parse it and search for it in the dataframe created. <br>
                             If the phrase was found in the dataframe, 3 words are returned, based on the frequency of the searched ngram. <br>
                             If the phrase is not found, the previous ngram is searched until some phrase or word is found in the dataframe. If no correspondence is detected,
                             the function return 3 random words from the most frequent found in the datasets.")

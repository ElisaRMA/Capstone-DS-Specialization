# Data Science Specialization - Captone Project

This repo contain all the material used for the Capstone Project of the Data Science Specialization at Coursera, provided by John Hopkins University.

This final Capstone project consisted of creating and deploying a text prediction model. 

# Instructions

Below, the project instructions copied from the course.

The goal of this exercise is to create a product to highlight the prediction algorithm that you have built and to provide an interface that can be accessed by others. For this project you must submit:

- A Shiny app that takes as input a phrase (multiple words) in a text box input and outputs a prediction of the next word.

- A slide deck consisting of no more than 5 slides created with R Studio Presenter (https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486468-Authoring-R-Presentations) pitching your algorithm and app as if you were presenting to your boss or an investor.
